It's loud, it's proud, and it's painted\nin pastel. Inspired by the \"Neubrutalism\" design trend (and specifically the\n\"Whalies\" theme), we believe that content should pop! 💥\n\n### What to expect?\n\n- **Bold Ideas:** Just like our borders.\n- **Fresh Content:** Served fast, directly from the edge.\n- **Colorful Vibes:** Because the web doesn't have to be black and white.\n\n## Under the Hood\n\nThis site is running on:\n\n- **Runtime:** Deno 2.0\n- **Framework:** Fresh 2.0\n- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4\n\n## 🤖 Built with AI\n\nHere's a fun fact: this entire blog—from the code to the content—was created\nwith the help of AI (Gemini Cli). It's a testament to how far AI-assisted\ndevelopment has come!\n\nStay tuned for more updates as we build this out! 🚀\n"
