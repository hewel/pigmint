# Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to **Pigmint**!

I'm excited to introduce this new blog, built on the bleeding edge with
[Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/).

## Why Pigmint?

Pigmint isn't just another minimal blog. It's loud, it's proud, and it's painted
in pastel. Inspired by the "Neubrutalism" design trend (and specifically the
"Whalies" theme), we believe that content should pop! 💥

### What to expect?

- **Bold Ideas:** Just like our borders.
- **Fresh Content:** Served fast, directly from the edge.
- **Colorful Vibes:** Because the web doesn't have to be black and white.

## Under the Hood

This site is running on:

- **Runtime:** Deno 2.0
- **Framework:** Fresh 2.0
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4

Stay tuned for more updates as we build this out! 🚀
